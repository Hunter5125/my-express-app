## 📝 Step-by-Step Instructions

### **STEP 1: Create GitHub Repository**

1. Open **https://github.com/new** in your browser
2. Fill in these details:
   - **Repository name**: `dayoff` (you can use any name)
   - **Description**: "Day Off Request Management System - Employee vacation request with approval workflow"
   - **Choose**: Public (if you want to share) or Private (for yourself)
   - **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT check "Initialize this repository with:"
   
3. Click **"Create repository"**

4. You'll see a page with commands - **COPY THESE COMMANDS**

### **STEP 2: Run GitHub Commands**

Open **PowerShell** in your DayOff project folder and run these commands (replace YOUR_USERNAME):

```powershell
cd 'c:\DayOff - Copy'

git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/dayoff.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**Replace `YOUR_USERNAME`** with your actual GitHub username.

### **STEP 3: Authenticate (Choose One)**

#### **Option A: Using GitHub CLI (Easiest)**
```powershell
gh auth login
# Then follow the prompts - press Enter through the defaults
```

#### **Option B: Using Personal Access Token**
1. Go to **https://github.com/settings/tokens**
2. Click **"Generate new token"** → **"Generate new token (classic)"**
3. Name it: `dayoff-token`
4. Check the box: ✅ `repo` (full control)
5. Scroll down and click **"Generate token"**
6. **Copy the token** (long random string)
7. When git asks for password, paste this token and press Enter
8. Save the token somewhere safe for future use

#### **Option C: Using SSH (Advanced)**
```powershell
# Generate key if you don't have one
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "yousef.dev.321@gmail.com"
# Press Enter 3 times to use defaults

# Add SSH key to GitHub:
# https://github.com/settings/keys
```

### **STEP 4: Wait for Upload**

You'll see output like:
```
Enumerating objects: 200, done.
Compressing objects: 100% (150/150), done.
Writing objects: 100% (200/200), 5.2 MB, done.
...
To https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/dayoff.git
 * [new branch]      main -> main
```
